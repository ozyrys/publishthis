drupal-publishthis
==================

This is a drupal module/plugin for the PublishThis platform


This is a Alpha version of a Drupal Plugin for pulling in
Curated content as Digest Posts or Blog Post Channel pages.

We are actively looking to find people to update this plugin
based on our API documentation represented here:

http://docs.publishthis.com/edcenter/developers-and-admins/api-reference/


If you have any questions, please contact your client services
contact at PublishThis.

If you wish to submit any changes/fixes/new features to this plugin
please make a request through github, and we will review the changes
and submit.

***** DISCLAIMER *****
We have built this module based off of our WordPress plugin, but it only
handles Curated content. There is no module in place for doing
automated content, or setting up Categories/Authors via a CMS
endpoint.
If you wish to get more information on the curation screens and
publishing actions, please refer to our wordpress documentation
for now until we can write documentation for Drupal.
http://docs.publishthis.com/edcenter/content-mixes/digest-post/wordpress-plugin-setup/
and
http://docs.publishthis.com/edcenter/content-mixes/blog-post-channel/blog-post-channel-wordpress-plugin-setup/

We are very open to having other developers submit patches/updates to this code
base. All you need to do is submit it through github, we will review, and
then accept or reject changes.  At this time, we are not actively updating
this code, but it provides a great base to build more Drupal functionality.
